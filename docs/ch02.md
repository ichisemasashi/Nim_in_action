In this chapter, you’ll learn about Nim’s syntax, procedures, for loops, and other basic aspects of the language. Throughout this chapter, we’ll cover a lot of informa- tion to give you a broad taste of the language.
Before you begin, make sure you have Nim installed and that it works on your computer. You’ll also need a text editor to edit Nim code. Take a look at appendix B for instructions on how to install Nim and other related tools.

## 2.1 Nim syntax

The syntax of a programming language is a set of rules that govern the way pro- grams are written in that language. You’ve already had a small taste of Nim’s syntax in the previous chapter.
Most languages share many similarities in terms of syntax. This is especially true for the C family of languages, which happens to also be the most popular—so much so that four of the most popular programming languages are syntactically heavily inspired by C.(1) Nim aims to be highly readable, so it often uses keywords instead of punctuation. Because of this, the syntax of Nim differs significantly from the C lan- guage family; instead, much of it is inspired by Python and Pascal.
In this section, I’ll teach you the basics of Nim’s syntax. Learning the syntax is a very important first step, as it teaches you the specific ways in which Nim code should be written.

### 2.1.1 Keywords

Most programming languages have the notion of a keyword, and Nim is no exception. A keyword is a word with a special meaning associated with it when it’s used in a specific context. Because of this, you may not use keywords as identifiers in your source code.

**STROPPING** You can get around this limitation by using stropping. See section 1.2 to learn more.

As of version 0.12.0, Nim has 70 keywords. This may sound like a lot, but you must remember that you won’t be using most of them. Some of them don’t yet have a meaning and are reserved for future versions of the language; others have minor use cases.
The most commonly used keywords allow you to do the following:

- Specify conditional branches: `if`, `case`, `of`, and `when`
- Define variables, procedures, and types: `var`, `let`, `proc`, `type`, and `object` 
- Handle runtime errors in your code: `try`, `except`, and `finally`

You’ll learn exactly what these keywords mean and how to use them in the next sec- tions of this chapter. For a full list of keywords, consult the Nim manual, available at http://nim-lang.org/docs/manual.html#lexical-analysis-identifiers-keywords.

### 2.1.2 Indentation

Many programmers indent their code to make the program’s structure more apparent. In most programming languages, this isn’t a requirement and serves only as an aid to human readers of the code. In those languages, keywords and punctuation are often used to delimit code blocks. In Nim, just like in Python, the indentation itself is used.
Let’s look at a simple example to demonstrate the difference. The following three code samples written in C, Ruby, and Nim all do the same thing. But note the differ- ent ways in which code blocks are delimited.

```
Listing 2.1 C
if (42 >= 0) {
  printf("42 is greater than 0");
}
```

```
Listing 2.2 Ruby
if 42 >= 0
  puts "42 is greater than 0"
end
```

```
Listing 2.3 Nim
if 42 >= 0:
  echo "42 is greater than 0"
```

As you can see, C uses curly brackets to delimit a block of code, Ruby uses the keyword end, and Nim uses indentation. Nim also uses the colon character on the line that pre- cedes the start of the indentation. This is required for the if statement and for many others. But as you continue learning about Nim, you’ll see that the colon isn’t required for all statements that start an indented code block.
Note also the use of the semicolon in listing 2.1. This is required at the end of each line in some programming languages (mostly the C family). It tells the compiler where a line of code ends. This means that a single statement can span multiple lines, or multiple statements can be on the same line. In C, you’d achieve both like this:

```
printf("The output is: %d",
  0);
printf("Hello"); printf("World");
```

In Nim, the semicolon is optional and can be used to write two statements on a single line. Spanning a single statement over multiple lines is a bit more complex—you can only split up a statement after punctuation, and the next line must be indented. Here’s an example:

```
echo("Output: ", <--- (1)
  5)
echo(5 +         <--- (1)
 5)
echo(5           <--- (2)
  + 5)
echo(5 +
5)               <--- (3)
```

1. Both of these statements are correct because they’ve been split after the punctuation and the next line has been indented.
2. This statement has been incorrectly split before the punctuation.
3. This statement has not been correctly indented after the split.

Because indentation is important in Nim, you need to be consistent in its style. The convention states that all Nim code should be indented by two spaces. The Nim com- piler currently disallows tabs because the inevitable mixing of spaces and tabs can have detrimental effects, especially in a whitespace-significant programming language.

### 2.1.3 Comments
Comments in code are important because they allow you to add additional meaning to pieces of code. Comments in Nim are written using the hash character (`#`). Any- thing following it will be a comment until the start of a new line. A multiline comment can be created with `#[` and `]#`, and code can also be disabled by using `when false:`. Here’s an example:

```
# Single-line comment
#[
Multiline comment
]#
when false:
  echo("Commented-out code")
```

The first of the two types of multiline comment can be used to comment out both text and code, whereas the latter should only be used to comment out code. The compiler will still parse the code and ensure that it’s syntactically valid, but it won’t be included in the resulting program. This is because the compiler checks `when` statements at com- pile time.

## 2.2 Nim basics

Now that you have a basic understanding of Nim’s syntax, you have a good foundation for learning some of the semantics of Nim. In this section, you’ll learn some of the essentials that every Nim programmer uses on a daily basis. You’ll learn about the most commonly used static types, the details of mutable and immutable variables, and how to separate commonly used code into standalone units by defining procedures.

### 2.2.1 Basic types

Nim is a statically typed programming language. This means that each identifier in Nim has a type associated with it at compile time. When you compile your Nim pro- gram, the compiler ensures that your code is type safe. If it isn’t, compilation termi- nates and the compiler outputs an error. This is in contrast to dynamically typed programming languages, such as Ruby, that will only ensure that your code is type safe at runtime.
By convention, type names start with an uppercase letter. Built-in types don’t follow this convention, so it’s easy for you to distinguish between built-in types and user- defined types by checking the first letter of the name. Nim supports many built-in types, including ones for dealing with the C foreign function interface (FFI). I don’t cover all of them here, but they will be covered later in this book.

**FOREIGN FUNCTION INTERFACE** The foreign function interface (FFI) is what allows you to use libraries written in other programming languages. Nim includes types that are native to C and C++, allowing libraries written in those languages to be used.

Most of the built-in types are defined in the `system` module, which is imported auto- matically into your source code. When referring to these types in your code, you can qualify them with the module name (for example, `system.int`), but doing so isn’t necessary. See table 2.1 for a list of the basic types defined in the system module.

**MODULES** Modules are imported using the `import` keyword. You’ll learn more about modules later in this book.

Table 2.1 Basic types

| Type | Description and uses |
| :--- | :------------------- |
| int  | The integer type is the type used for whole numbers; for example, `52`.|
| float | The `float` is the type used for numbers with a decimal point; for example, `2.5`. |
| string | The `string` type is used to store multiple characters. String literals are created by placing multiple characters inside double quotes: `"Nim is awesome"`. |
| bool | The Boolean type stores one of two values, either `true` or `false`. |
| char | The character type stores a single ASCII character. Character literals are created
by placing a character inside single quotes; for example, `'A'`. |

**INTEGER**

The integer type represents numerical data without a fractional component; that is, whole numbers. The amount of data this type can store is finite, so there are multiple versions of it in Nim, each suited to different size requirements. The main integer type in Nim is `int`. It’s the integer type you should be using most in your Nim pro- grams. See table 2.2 for a list of integer types.

Table 2.2 Integer types

![table2.2](../pic/table2_2_1.png)
![table2.2](../pic/table2_2_2.png)

An integer literal in Nim can be represented using decimal, octal, hexadecimal, or binary notation.

```
Listing 2.4 Integer literals
let decimal = 42
let hex = 0x42
let octal = 0o42
let binary = 0b101010
```

Listing 2.4 defines four integer variables and assigns a different integer literal to each of them, using the four different integer-literal formats.
You’ll note that the type isn’t specified for any of the defined variables. The Nim compiler will infer the correct type based on the integer literal that’s specified. In this case, all variables will have the type `int`.
The compiler determines which integer type to use by looking at the size of the integer literal. The type is `int64` if the integer literal exceeds the 32-bit range; other- wise, it’s `int`. But what if you want to use a specific integer type for your variable? There are multiple ways to accomplish this:

```
let a: int16 = 42  <---(1)
let b = 42'i8      <---(2)
```

1. `int16`
2. Uses a type suffix to specify the type of the integer literal

**INTEGER SIZE** Explicitly using a small integer type such as `int8` may result in a compile-time or, in some cases, a runtime error. Take a look at the ranges in table 2.2 to see what size of integer can fit into which integer type. You should be careful not to attempt to assign an integer that’s bigger or smaller than the type can hold.


Nim supports type suffixes for all integer types, both signed and unsigned. The format is `'iX`, where `X` is the size of the signed integer, and `'uX`, where `X` is the size of the unsigned integer.(2)

**FLOATING-POINT**
The floating-point type represents an approximation of numerical data with a frac- tional component. The main floating-point type in Nim is `float`, and its size depends on the platform.


```
Listing 2.5 Float literals
let a = 1'f32
let b = 1.0e19
```

The compiler will implicitly use the `float` type for floating-point literals.
You can specify the type of the literal using a type suffix. There are two type suf- fixes for floats that correspond to the available floating-point types: `'f32` for `float32`
and `'f64` for `float64`.
Exponents can also be specified after the number. Variable b in the preceding list-
ing will be equal to 1x10^(19) (1 times 10 to the power of 19).

**BOOLEAN**
The Boolean type represents one of two values: usually a true or false value. In Nim, the Boolean type is called `bool`.

```
Listing 2.6 Boolean literals
let a = false
let b = true
```

The `false` and `true` values of a Boolean must begin with a lowercase letter.


**CHARACTER**
The character type represents a single character. In Nim, the character type is called char. It can’t represent UTF-8 characters but instead encodes ASCII characters. Because of this, char is really just a number.
A character literal in Nim is a single character enclosed in quotes. The character may also be an escape sequence introduced by a backward slash (`\`). Some common character-escape sequences are listed in table 2.3.

```
Listing 2.7 Character literals
let a = 'A'
let b = '\109'
let c = '\x79'
```

**UNICODE** The `unicode` module contains a `Rune` type that can hold any uni- code character.

**NEWLINE ESCAPE SEQUENCE** The newline escape sequence `\n` isn’t allowed in a character literal as it may be composed of multiple characters on some plat- forms. On Windows, it’s `\r\l` (carriage return followed by line feed),whereas on Linux it’s just `\l` (line feed). Specify the character you want explicitly, such as `'\r'` to get a carriage return, or use a string.

Table 2.3  Common character-escape sequences

| Escape sequence | Result |
| :--- | :--- |
| \r, \c | Carriage return |
| \l | Line feed |
| \t | Tab |
| \\ | Backslash |
| \' | Apostrophe |
| \" | Quotation mark |

**STRING**

 The string type represents a sequence of characters. In Nim, the string type is called `string`. It’s a list of characters terminated by `'\0'`.
The `string` type also stores its length. A string in Nim can store UTF-8 text, but the `unicode` module should be used for processing it, such as when you want to change the case of UTF-8 characters in a string.
There are multiple ways to define string literals, such as this:

```
let text = "The book title is \"Nim in Action\""
```

When defining string literals this way, certain characters must be escaped in them. For instance, the double-quote character (`"`) should be escaped as `\"` and the backward- slash character (`\`) as `\\`. String literals support the same character-escape sequences that character literals support; see table 2.3 for a good list of the common ones. One major additional escape sequence that string literals support is `\n`, which produces a newline; the actual characters that are produced depend on the platform.

The need to escape some characters makes some things tedious to write. One example is Windows file paths:

```
let filepath = "C:\\Program Files\\Nim"
```

Nim supports raw string literals that don’t require escape sequences. Apart from the double-quote character (`"`), which still needs to be escaped as `""`, any character placed in a raw string literal will be stored verbatim in the string. A raw string literal is a string literal preceded by an `r`:

```
let filepath = r"C:\Program Files\Nim"
```

It’s also possible to specify multiline strings using triple-quoted string literals:

```
let multiLine = """foo
  bar
  baz
"""
echo multiLine
```

The output for the preceding code looks like this:

```
foo
  bar
  baz
```

Triple-quoted string literals are enclosed between three double-quote characters, and these string literals may contain any characters, including the double-quote character, without any escape sequences. The only exception is that your string literal may not repeat the double-quote character three times. There’s no way to include three double- quote characters in a triple-quoted string literal.

The indentation added to the string literal defining the `multiLine` variable causes leading whitespace to appear at the start of each line. This can be easily fixed by the use of the `unindent` procedure. It lives in the `strutils` module, so you must first import it:

```
import strutils
let multiLine = """foo
  bar
  baz
"""
echo multiLine.unindent
```

This will produce the following output:

```
foo
bar
baz
```


### 2.2.2 Defining variables and other storage

Storage in Nim is defined using three different keywords. In addition to the `let` key- word, which you saw in the previous section, you can also define storage using `const` and `var`.

```Nim
let number = 10
```

By using the `let` keyword, you’ll be creating what’s known as an immutable variable—a variable that can only be assigned to once. In this case, a new immutable variable named number is created, and the identifier `number` is bound to the value `10`. If you attempt to assign a different value to this variable, your program won’t compile, as in the following numbers.nim example:

```Nim
let number = 10
number = 4000
```

The preceding code will produce the following output when compiled:

```Nim
numbers.nim(2, 1) Error: 'number' cannot be assigned to
```

Nim also supports mutable variables using the keyword `var`. Use these if you intend on changing the value of a variable. The previous example can be fixed by replacing the `let` keyword with the `var` keyword:

```Nim
var number = 10
number = 4000
```

In both examples, the compiler will infer the type of the `number` variable based on the value assigned to it. In this case, `number` will be an `int`. You can specify the type explic- itly by writing the type after the variable name and separating it with a colon character (`:`). By doing this, you can omit the assignment, which is useful when you don’t want to assign a value to the variable when defining it.

```Nim
var number: int   <--- This will be initialized to 0.
```

 **IMMUTABLE VARIABLES** Immutable variables must be assigned a value when they’re defined because their values can’t change. This includes both `const` and `let` defined storage.

A variable’s initial value will always be binary zero. This will manifest in different ways, depending on the type. For example, by default, integers will be `0` and strings will be `nil`. `nil` is a special value that signifies the lack of a value for any reference type. You’ll learn more about this later.

The type of a variable can’t change. For example, assigning a `string` to an `int` vari- able will result in a compile-time error, as in this typeMismatch.nim example:

```Nim
var number = 10
number = "error"
```

Here’s the error output:

```
typeMismatch.nim(2, 10) Error: type mismatch: got (string) but expected 'int'
```

Nim also supports constants. Because the value of a constant is also immutable, con- stants are similar to immutable variables defined using `let`. But a Nim constant differs in one important way: its value must be computable at compile time.

```Nim
Listing 2.8 Constant example

proc fillString(): string =
  result = ""
  echo("Generating string")
  for i in 0 .. 4:
    result.add($i) <--- (1)
const count = fillString()
```

(1) The `$` is a commonly used operator in Nim that converts its input to a string.


  **PROCEDURES** Don’t worry about not understanding the details of procedures in Nim yet. You’ll be introduced to them shortly.

The `fillString` procedure in listing 2.8 will generate a new string, equal to `"01234"`. The constant `count` will then be assigned this string.

I added the `echo` at the top of `fillString`’s body, in order to show you that it’s exe- cuted at compile time. Try compiling the example using Aporia or in a terminal by executing `nim c file.nim`. You’ll see `"Generating string"` amongst the output. Run- ning the binary will never display that message because the result of the `fillString` procedure is embedded in it.

In order to generate the value of the constant, the `fillString` procedure must be executed at compile time by the Nim compiler. You have to be aware, though, that not all code can be executed at compile time. For example, if a compile-time procedure uses the FFI, you’ll find that the compiler will output an error similar to “Error: cannot 'importc' variable at compile time.”

The main benefit of using constants is efficiency. The compiler can compute a value for you at compile time, saving time that would be otherwise spent during run- time. The obvious downside is longer compilation time, but it could also produce a larger executable size. As with many things, you must find the right balance for your use case. Nim gives you the tools, but you must use them responsibly.(*3)

You can also specify multiple variable definitions under the same `var`, `let`, or `const` keyword. To do this, add a new line after the keyword and indent the identifier on the next line:

```Nim
var
  text = "hello"
  number: int = 10
  isTrue = false
```

The identifier of a variable is its name. It can contain any characters, as long as the name doesn’t begin with a number and doesn’t contain two consecutive underscores. This applies to all identifiers, including procedure and type names. Identifiers can even make use of Unicode characters:

```Nim
var 火 = "Fire"
let ogie ́n = true
```

Unlike in many other programming languages, identifiers in Nim are case insensitive with the exception of the first letter of the identifier. This is to help distinguish vari- able names, which must begin with lowercase letters, from type names, which must begin with uppercase letters.

Identifiers in Nim are also style insensitive. This allows identifiers written in `camelCase` to be equivalent to identifiers written in `snake_case`. The way this is accomplished is by ignoring the underscore character in identifiers, so `fooBar` is equivalent to `foo_bar`. You’re free to write identifiers in whichever style you prefer, even when they’re defined in a different style. But you’re encouraged to follow Nim’s style conventions, which specify that variables should use `camelCase` and types should use `PascalCase`. For more information about Nim’s conventions, take a look at the “Style Guide for Nim Code” on GitHub: https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/wiki/Style-Guide-for-Nim-Code.

-----
#### Stropping

As you may recall from section 2.1, there are identifiers in Nim that are reserved. Such identifiers are called keywords, and because they have a special meaning, they can’t be used as names for variables, types, or procedures.

In order to get around this limitation, you can either pick a different name or explicitly mark the identifier using backticks (`). The latter approach is called stropping, and here’s how it can be used:

```Nim
var `var` = "Hello"
echo(`var`)
```

The `var` keyword is enclosed in backticks, allowing a variable with that name to be defined.
